/**
 * Discovery resolves to the nearest declared candidate that exists, and to
 * nothing at all when none of them do.
 *
 * A literal source pinned here pins the maintainer's disk instead of the
 * contract. `sibling_dependency_checkout` resolves to `../agent-teams-playbook`,
 * so it is found on a machine that keeps the upstream package cloned beside this
 * repository and absent on one that does not: measured on this host it reports
 * `"sibling_dependency_checkout"` at version `4.8.0`, and on a host without that
 * sibling the very same code correctly reports `null`. Both literals are true
 * somewhere and neither is a property of the code, so asserting either one makes
 * the suite pass or fail on where it is run.
 *
 * The precedence rule is the part that holds on every disk, and it is the rule
 * the ordered candidate list exists to express: a farther candidate may never win
 * over a nearer one, and the reported version must belong to whichever candidate
 * won rather than to some other entry. Because this recomputes the production
 * rule it can only catch that rule changing, so the literal outcome is pinned
 * separately below, against a dependency root the test plants itself.
