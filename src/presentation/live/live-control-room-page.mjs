   * A card only states its own height while the canvas is drawing cards. Cell

   * which of the two is showing, so a measurement that inherits the presentation
   * reserves the band and leaves the card short the moment the viewer zooms in.
   * The scene also carries the camera transform, so a client rect answers in
   * screen pixels while this layout is written in world pixels; reserving that
   * made the spacing between rows depend on where the zoom happened to be when
   * the layout last ran. Reading the layout box under a named presentation
   * removes both.
   *
   * The previous pass's reservation is cleared first because it was written back
   * onto the card as an inline min-height. Measuring over it reads that answer
   * back as though it were the card, so the height could only ever climb.
   *
   * The capability strips are read in the same sweep, and for the same reason:
   * these are the only conditions under which a strip states its own geometry
   * rather than whatever the last reservation clamped it to. What comes out is the
   * per-row step and the card chrome the next layout will reserve with, replacing

  /**
   * The eight-stage rail is a disclosure widget whose expanded height competes
   * with the graph canvas. Its default state used to be predicted by comparing
   * the window height against a sum of chrome band heights written down in
   * config. That sum was a second authority for a height the browser already
   * knows, and it could not be right at every width, because a media gate
   * restacks the run-context band and changes the composition the sum describes.
   *
   * The state is now decided from the canvas the page actually rendered: expand
   * the rail, force layout, read the canvas back, and keep the rail open only if
   * what is left still clears the canvas floor. Opening and measuring inside one
   * task costs no visible flicker, because forcing layout does not paint. An
   * explicit user toggle wins for the rest of the session and is deliberately
   * not persisted: a stored preference would reintroduce the too-small canvas on
   * the next visit to a short display.

/*
 * Edge ink is held in two ordered tokens rather than per-rule hexes because the
 * obligation is a ratio, not a colour: a graph edge is a non-text graphical object,
 * so it owes 3:1 against what it is drawn on. What it is drawn on is not the fill
 * at the top of this sheet — the desktop band re-declares the canvas to #0e151f and
 * the canvas paints a 28px grid, so the binding background is a grid line over the
 * desktop fill. Measured there, the original values were 1.28 (structural), 2.00
 * (base) and 1.41 (queued): all three failed, and raising opacity alone could not
 * fix them because #40506a tops out at 1.96. Opacity is pinned at 1 on every rule
 * below so it cannot quietly re-enter the ratio later.
 *
 * The tokens were raised again after the floor was met because clearing 3:1 left
 * the start-of-run graph — every edge queued or structural, nothing glowing yet —
 * as the quietest thing on the screen: #6b7a94/#79899f measured 3.68-4.53 against
 * the binding backdrops. They now sit at #8f9db8/#97a4bd (5.84-6.43 measured the
 * same way) with the base stroke at 1.8px, so the pre-run shape is readable at a
 * glance while the teal running ink — glow, 2.35px, animation — stays the single
 * loudest colour on the canvas.
